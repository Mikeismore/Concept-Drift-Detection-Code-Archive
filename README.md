# Concept Drift Detection Code Archive
This contains the code archive for all the scripts that were used for my bachelor thesis project "Concept Drift Detection of Power Consumption Side-Channel Attacks". In this project I analysed the existence and detection of Concept Drift in Template Attacks.

The data that used for the scripts is not publicly available. Therefore, the results are not reproducible. The data was collected by the Chipwhisperer Lite with UFO board. The Chipwhisperer measured the power consumption of an ARM Cortex-M processor, STM32F32 by STmicroelectronices, that was using AES-128 encryption.
